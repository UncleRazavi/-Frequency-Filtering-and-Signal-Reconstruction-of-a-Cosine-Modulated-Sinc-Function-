# Cosine-Modulated Sinc Signal Filtering and Analysis

This Python script analyzes and filters a cosine-modulated sinc signal using Fourier Transform techniques. It visualizes both the frequency spectrum and the time-domain representation of the filtered signal.

## Overview
The script generates a sinc function modulated by a cosine wave, applies a low-pass filter to isolate frequencies below a specified threshold, and reconstructs the filtered signal. The results are plotted in both frequency and time domains for analysis.

## Features
- **Signal Generation**: Creates a cosine-modulated sinc signal.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Computes the Fourier Transform to obtain the frequency spectrum of the signal.
- **Filtering**: Applies a low-pass filter to isolate low-frequency components.
- **Visualization**: Plots the magnitude of the original and filtered signals in both frequency and time
