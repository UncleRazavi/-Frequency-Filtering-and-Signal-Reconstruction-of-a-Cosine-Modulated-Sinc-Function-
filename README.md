# Cosine-Modulated Sinc Signal: Filtering and Analysis

This Python script generates, analyzes, and filters a cosine-modulated sinc signal using Fourier Transform techniques. It visualizes both the frequency spectrum and the reconstructed time-domain signal.

## Overview
The script creates a sinc function modulated by a cosine wave, applies a low-pass filter to isolate desired frequencies, and reconstructs the filtered signal. Results are displayed in both frequency and time domains for easy analysis.

## Features
- **Signal Generation**: Creates a cosine-modulated sinc signal.  
- **Frequency Analysis**: Computes the Fourier Transform to obtain the signalâ€™s frequency spectrum.  
- **Filtering**: Applies a low-pass filter to extract low-frequency components.  
- **Visualization**: Plots the original and filtered signals in both time and frequency domains.
